# obsidian-back-to-top
The Obsidian Back to Top plugin adds a floating button to your notes that allows you to quickly scroll back to the top of the note. When you scroll down a note, the button will appear in the lower right corner of the screen. Clicking on the button will instantly take you back to the top of the note, saving you time and effort.
